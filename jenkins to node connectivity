Access the container running Jenkins:
#docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
Once inside the container's shell, navigate to the Jenkins home directory:
#cd /var/jenkins_home/.ssh
Use the ssh-keyscan command to retrieve the host key for (node ip) and append it to the known hosts file:
#ssh-keyscan (node ip) >> known_hosts
Verify that the host key has been added to the file:
#cat known_hosts
Exit the container's shell:
#exit
